# Decision Tree Analysis for Product Launch using Excel

This project demonstrates how to use Excel to model decision-making under uncertainty using a real-world case from Clean & Brite (C&B). The product manager must decide whether to launch a new product based on market research, expected monetary value (EMV), and risk preferences.

## 🎯 Business Scenario

- **Product Success**: +$1.8M  
- **Product Failure**: −$750K  
- **Market Research Cost**: $130K  
- **Success probability estimate**: 35%

## 📈 Tools and Techniques

- Decision Tree modeling in Excel
- Bayes' Theorem & Total Probability Law
- Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI)
- Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)
- Sensitivity analysis across probability combinations
- Risk profiling with probabilistic outcomes

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Without research**: Launching yields EMV = $142,500  
- **With research**: Best strategy EMV = $227,750  
- **EVSI**: $215,250  
- **EVPI**: $487,500  
- Research only makes sense if cost < EVPI
